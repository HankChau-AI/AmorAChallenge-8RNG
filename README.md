Challenge #8 RNG 

Created a page that randomizes from a list of codestack students. Displays their full names and emails. Is themed like the jigsaw meme. 

Peer: Alan Batres
Peer Review: The functionality of the code works great I didn't find any problems with it and I like that it shows the previous 5 by replacing the oldest person on the list. I really like the theme you have good job
